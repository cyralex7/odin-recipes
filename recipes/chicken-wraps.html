<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Honey and salsa come together to make an easy summer meal that will rock your taste buds!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>¼ cup finely chopped seedless cucumber</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into thin strips</li>
    <li>1 cup thick and chunky salsa</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>8 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
    <li>1 (10 ounce) bag baby spinach leaves</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix together the mayonnaise, cucumber, 1 tablespoon of honey, 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and black pepper in a bowl until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until needed.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet on medium-high heat, and cook and stir the chicken breast strips until they are beginning to turn golden and are no longer pink in the middle, about 8 minutes. Stir in the salsa, 1 tablespoon of honey, and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Stack the tortillas, 4 at a time, in a microwave oven and heat until warm and pliable, 20 to 30 seconds per batch.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Spread each tortilla with 1 tablespoon of the mayonnaise-cucumber mixture, top with a layer of baby spinach leaves, and arrange about 1/2 cup of chicken mixture on the spinach leaves.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Fold the bottom of each tortilla up about 2 inches, and start rolling the burrito from the right side. When the burrito is half-rolled, fold the top of the tortilla down, enclosing the filling, and continue rolling to make a tight, compact cylinder.</li>
